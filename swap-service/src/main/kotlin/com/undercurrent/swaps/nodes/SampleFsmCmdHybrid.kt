/**
 * Given the extensive list of commands, we can use a combination of the
 * Finite State Machine (FSM) approach and a Command Pattern. The FSM will handle
 * the lifecycle and transitions, while the Command Pattern will encapsulate each command
 * into an object, allowing for parameterization of commands, queuing of commands,
 * and other operations.
 *
 * State represents the different states of the chatbot.
 * Event represents the different events or user actions that can occur.
 * Command is an interface that encapsulates each command into an object.
 * ShopBotFSM is the finite state machine that handles state transitions based
 * on events and provides a display message for the current state.
 *
 * This approach allows for easy expansion. If you want to add
 * a new command, you simply create a new command class that implements
 * the Command interface and add it to the commands map in ShopBotFSM.
 *
 * This is a basic example, and in a real-world scenario, you'd likely
 * have more states, events, conditions, and command logic.
